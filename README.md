## About the Project

FLARESat is a web-based platform for satellite monitoring and data visualization. This project was developed for the NASA![Uploading logo.png…]()
 Apps Challenge 2025 for the catagory Commercializing Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The hackathon took place October 4th 2025 and lasted 48 hours. In this time we created a satellite constellation, CAD model, simulated expected data, custom lenses, and a working dashboard to compare our system against the exisiting NASA FIRMS satellites.

## Features

- Interactive satellite visualization
- Real-time data monitoring utilizing API calls from NASA's FIRMS comparing our idea with exisiting data.
- Web-based interface
- Dashboard portal for cust

## Dashboard
Example of Dashboard at 3x Speed.
